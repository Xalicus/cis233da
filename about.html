				<h2>Life and family</h2>
				<p>I've been creating websites for over 19+ years, since I was in high school. I went to a Tech School called East Valley Institute of Technology, or EVIT for short. I would go to my normal classes then for half of the day, I'd take a bus ride to EVIT and learn to code webpages and other cool 3D images and animation type stuff. It was a nice learning experience, and I would recommend it to anyone who can do it.
				</p>
				
				<p>I met my wife at an anime group we both went to, just because we knew some of the members who always went on Friday nights, and they invited us to go. The Friday before Memorial Day 2004, I found out who she was from the online forum they hosted, that we were talking together on for a few weeks.
				</p>
				
				<p>My wife gave birth to Artemis last year and she has been a shining light as she brings many smiles and giggly laughter in our lives.

				<h1>My Favorite Quotes</h1>
				
				<blockquote><!-- FR:Blockquote tag used to show quotes I like. 12/2/2017 -->
				"Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends."
				<br><br>
				"Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass."
				<br><br>
				<cite>-Samuel L. Jackson</cite><!-- FR:Text Level Elements 5 "CITE" tags used to show creator of said quote. 12/2/2017 -->

				<blockquote>
				"Do. Or do not. There is no try."
				<br><br>
				"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger; anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you."
				<br><br>
				<cite>-Yoda</cite>
				</blockquote>
				
				<blockquote>
				PALPATINE: Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
				<br><br>
				ANAKIN: No.
				<br><br>
				PALPATINE: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
				<br><br>
				ANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?
				<br><br>
				PALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
				<br><br>
				ANAKIN: What happened to him?
				<br><br>
				PALPATINE: He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. &#40;smiles&#41; Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death but not himself.
				<br><br>
				ANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?
				<br><br>
				PALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.
