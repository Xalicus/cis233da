				<h2>Design Consultants</h2>
				
				<p>
					"I know it sounds weird that a company like Design Consultants went to an outside source for our own website, but Kevin was highly recommended from our friends and colleagues, that we had to give him a try. I for one am glad we did. He did an amazing job at finding the right balance of style and modern design that we just couldn't figure out at the time. I definitely recommend Xalicus Studios to do websites for people, but just don't tell them I said that. We are rivals after all."

				<h2>Misty Mountains Resort</h2>
				
				<p>
					"When Kevin Ward at Xalicus Studios took on the contract for making our site, I was so relieved. I had been working on it for weeks, and nothing seemed to make it look right. I contracted XS and now the Misty Mountains Resort site looks like a million and a half bucks! I owe everything to Xalicus Studios."
